ln -s ../top/ /Users/bago/RailsProjects/omoroi/omoroi-fe/pages/_locale/

- I uploaded an extra pic in the folder can you see it?
-> Yeah I saw it and put it in the carousel. Btw, you need to tell me in what order you the pictures to slide

- The menu is now visible and expands, but can we have it drop downward like the cry55 site?
Or can we have a closing “x” on the top right, so it can collapse back?
-> I added the 'x' on the top right, so give it a try :)

- can we have the “omoroi” first o be lowercase?
-> Done

- can the flag be a bit closer to the menu bars
-> I moved it as closer as I could, put it more closer will break the menu icon

- Also can we have it say menu above like cry55?
-> which menu ? Are you talking about 3 links (social language and sport ?)

- pic timing is good, just the first time I tried to open the page it took sometime to load
-> Should not be a problem as soon as I will found a way to reduce the size of pictures

- as for mobile picture size, can we make them the same size as either cry55 or our current site?
But before the pictures, again want the 3 categories like the cry55 site
-> working on it..


Social 
Language 
Sports

Just had a thought... can put a really thin line between language and sns buttons?

Yeeeah I modified the size of the pictures on mobile :) !!
It's so beautifile on mobile now, I really like it.
Since all images are smaller, not only the quality of the image look better, but also the loading time has been greatly reduced.
(I had new pics, so the first time you load the website it's a bit long but once you refresh, since images are cached, it should be fast)
Tell me what do you think :).
