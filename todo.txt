- can the thin blue line be a little thinner? Same as cry55
-> I reduce from 7px to 5px, is it OK ?

- yah I guess only need 1 flag
-> OK I put only one flag :)

- also it is highlighted (can we just have it be the same as the background color always)
-> Fixed

- can we make the flag more square, to match dimensions of fb and Twitter buttons 
I'm using iconfinder to find flags. Could you have a look at it and tell me which set of flag you like

- let’s keep background that kind of light grey (looks good)
-> Understood

- the menu doesn’t seem to be on the mobile version
-> I reframed the menu can you see it and click it ?

- can we make the left logo clickable, so always links back to home/top page?
-> Done

- yah need better resolution pics (deleted the bad res pics and added maybe better ones)
-> Waiting for your new pics :)

- yah mobile version pics are too big
-Working on it now

- also both versions seem to load slow
-> What do you mean by slow ? You mean the rotation of the pictures ?
